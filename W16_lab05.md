Danielle Dodd and George Lieu


(a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I'm looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
    When the game starts, a player sprite and a "map" appear. The goal of the game is to find all of the treasure pieces behind the grass. 


    (b) (20 pts) a set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
    As a player, I can move to different locations on the map so that I can find the treasure.
    As a player, I can find where the treasures are located so that I can win the game.
    As a player, I can move around the map so that I can explore even after all the treasures are found.

    (c) (20 pts) a brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does,
    The current state of the game will run, but after using ant clean, the map will appear but the player sprite will not appear. This was an issue in the original github marked as corrected but was actually not.    

    (c) (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.
    As a player, I can now search for the treasures that are randomly placed so that I don't know where it is every time I start the game.
    As a player, I can see the treasure icons and not just the text box so that I find so that the game is more interesting.   
    As a player, I can receive a "You win!" message after finding the laster treasure so that I know I found every treasure.

    (d) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?
    The README.md file suggests that the game is fully functional. However, we cannot get the player sprite to load.
    In Developer Notes, it says that GameComponent.java contains information about the issues but it would also be useful to add the issues directly into the README. Furthermore, the descriptions of the .java files could be a little more verbose. 

    (e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
    The build file does not seem to have any outdated code. The descriptions are fine. However, when we use ant -p, the javadoc target does not show up even though ant javadoc does work. Furthermore, there seems to be a problem with the ant compile or the ant clean target as there was a problem with loading the player sprite and treasure pieces. This has already been fixed by us.  

    (f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current "issues". Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?
    The current issues are clear in what is needed to be improved and implemented. There is more than 1000 points that can be earned working on this project.  
    
    (g) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.

    (h) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just "one screenful of text" to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?
    GameGui.java contains the main method as well as the go() method that launches the game components: the frame, treasures, bushes, and player sprite. It also contains the MoveAction class which moves the character. The MoveAction constructor is kind of confusing to understand with no comments. The actionPerformed method of the MoveAction event actually moves the character. The last method, addBindings() allows the user to use the keyboard to move the character, however the implementation might be outdated.
    the bin and resources directories contain the images of the treasure, bush, grass, and player movement pictures. The bin and resource directories seem to contain duplicate pictures. There is also a map.txt file that contains characters. These characters correspond to a certain tile piece and its image. 
    The GameComponent.java actually draws and loads the components of the game including the sprite, grass, and treasure areas. There are some pieces of code commented out. The methods are generally well named and placed.
    The Player.java file contains the class player and has methods to set Sprite, get its location, check if its movable, and move it to a certain location.
    The PlayerTest.java file contains a series of JUnit tests in order to make sure the sprite is being implemented correctly.
    Another issue with this project is that there seems to be duplicate "resources" folder and multiple copies of the png file. It might be necessary to figure out which pictures are actually being used, factor that out into its own resource file on the top, and delete all of the other unused .png files. 

    (i) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
    There are JUnit tests in the PlayerTest.java file. It seems to be pretty thorough in testing all the necessary methods for the player class. However, it is unclear how to run these tests since it does not show up using the ant -p command. There are opportunities to expand test coverage by testing other components of the game such as the treasure location, whether the treasures are placed within the bounds of the map, and if all the treasures have been found (and the message pops up).
